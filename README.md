##### Project Description
The Settlers of the Catan is a strategy game played by 3-4 people where everyone plays in turns. The game starts by assembling hexagonal map pieces and shuffling and placing the cards. Each player chooses his/her figure to play with. Construction price cards are distributed to players where the information about construction such as village or cities and the points they provide are written. At the beginning of the first turn, the player who has the turn rolls two die and place villages and roads on the map to a place he desires. After each player settles his/her first villages and roads, the competition starts. In each tour, the player rolls the die and can collect sources, buy or use development cards, trade (swap sources), and do construction. After the die are rolled, players who have own constructions lying on that numbered map gains sources. There are five types of source cards which are wood, brick, iron, sheep, and wheat. These source cards are utilized while doing construction and buying development cards. If the sum of numbers on the die is seven, each player who has seven or more cards places half of them to the chest, also the player who has rolled the die can place the thief figure on wherever place on map he/she wishes where the next player won't be able to get source cards from that place. The player who places the thief gets a random source card from each player who owns construction in that place. The player who owns the tour can trade his/her source cards with other players or the chest. In order to construct a village, the player must reach that part of the game by building roads. Villages can be upgraded to cities. There are three types of development cards that add more game functionality to the game. If a player collects 10 points from constructions and cards, the player wins and the game ends.
